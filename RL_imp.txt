Look at:
- env_wrapper for how game state and observations are used
- heuristic_agent has the deterministic one we made 
    - Say it gets it in 50, instead of random being in the 70s
    - Also strictly dominant over the random one winning 100 out of 100 games.
- policy_network has the neural network information
- generate_dataset is how I made the Behaviour Cloning stuff
- train_bc and train_ppo are how stuff is trained, it's just boilerplate don't worry too much
