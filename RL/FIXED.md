# Bug Fixed! âœ…

## The Problem

The game was initializing with **0 cards in the market** and deadlocking after ~7 turns.

## Root Cause

The C++ game engine uses a relative path to load card data:
```cpp
auto all_cards = CSVParser::ParseCardsCSV("data/cards.csv");
```

When running scripts from the `RL/` directory, it was looking for `RL/data/cards.csv` which doesn't exist.
The actual file is at `data/cards.csv` (relative to project root).

## The Fix

Updated `env_wrapper.py` to change the working directory to the project root before importing the game module:

```python
# IMPORTANT: Change working directory to project root so C++ can find data/cards.csv
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))
if os.path.exists(os.path.join(project_root, 'data', 'cards.csv')):
    os.chdir(project_root)
```

## Results

**Before Fix:**
- Market: 0 cards
- Episode length: 7 turns
- Immediate deadlock
- No prestige points earned

**After Fix:**
- Market: 12 cards (4 per tier) âœ…
- Episode length: 72-73 turns âœ…
- Real gameplay âœ…
- Prestige points earned âœ…

## Now Everything Works!

```bash
cd RL
python generate_dataset.py --num_games 100 --output bc_data.npz
```

This will generate a proper dataset with full Splendor games!
